## Docker Setup:
For ease of running the web application you just have to:
- install docker on your system (if windows --> Docker Desktop)
- go to this directory in your powershell terminal
- execute "docker compose build"
- execute "docker compose up -d"

the system is then up and running on "http://localhost:4200"


If you'd like to run the web application yourself read on:


## Manual Setup:
Make sure you have Node and npm installed on your machine.

Start Backend:
Change into your backend folder in your terminal and execute following commands:
"npm install"
"npm run start:prod" for creating the Backendserver which manages all the Websocket Connections and relays the messages

Start Frontend:
Go into the frontend folder in your terminal and execute 
"npm install"
"npm start" for creating a development webserver which in turn hosts the angular app on "http://localhost:4200"
